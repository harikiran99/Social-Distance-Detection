# Social-Distance-Detection

The implemented social distance detection system showcases a comprehensive and 
modular approach, covering image processing, video analysis, and real-time webcam 
monitoring. Leveraging the YOLO model, we have created the code which efficiently detects 
persons, assesses social distancing adherence, and visually communicates potential violations. 
The image and video implementations facilitate analysis in both static and dynamic scenarios, 
while the live cam implementation extends the functionality to real-time applications. The user-friendly main program enables easy selection of the desired mode, offering flexibility for 
different data sources. By combining advanced computer vision techniques with intuitive user 
interaction, the system contributes to the ongoing efforts in leveraging technology for public 
health and safety, providing a versatile tool for monitoring social distancing practices in various 
environments
